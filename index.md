I am a hacker and an aspiring computer scientist. I'm currently doing my Masters program in Computer Science (Algorithms, Logic and Languages) at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. 

I believe we are versatile beings and I like to work on different problems with varying natures and challenges. Currently, I'm involved in academics. In the past, I've worked in the industry in various roles.

## Interests and current work

Technology and programming excites me, but not more than the underlying theory. My specific theoretical interests include programming languages.

My primary focus now is to build a strong theoretical foundation through my masters program at Chalmers. Also, I actively take part in the IT industry as a part-time software consultant.

## Some rant

Programming languages provide powerful abstractions to build software systems. Much success has been achieved in sequential computation - we have a plethora of high level programming languages which ensure we don't worry too much about memory management, run time safety and other similar "low level" problems. It is the age of distributed computation and we are still using tools designed for sequential computation. It appears that when building distributed systems, we spend most of our time solving concurrency and communication problems. It would be useful to have tools (say a programming language) to solve these problems internally and provide an effective abstraction to build distributed systems. This way, one can focus on the application logic instead of writing tedious communication protocols, synchronization algorithms etc. This is an interesting area of research. This is also an active area of research - most notably, the [ABCD project](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/abcd) by Philip Wadler et al.
