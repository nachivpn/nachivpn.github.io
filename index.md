PhD student at Chalmers University on the [Octopi project](https://octopi.chalmers.se/). I study programming languages, and my research interests lie in the areas of functional programming, type systems and language-based security. Currently, I spend an awful lot of time thinking about the development of normalization and partial evaluation techniques for various programming language applications.
