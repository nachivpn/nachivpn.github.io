I am a hacker who has been around in the software industry since I graduated from NIT Calicut in 2014. I look forward to pursuing higher education in the near future.  Currently, I work as a software developer at Acrodelon R&D on some very interesting problems.

## Interests

Technology and programming excites me, but not more than the underlying theory. My specific theoretical interests (currently) include programming languages. I hope to do some research in the area of programming languages during my stint as a post-graduate student. 

More than the output of the research, it is the process of problem solving that I am more interested in. My choice of programming languages is mostly driven by my belief that the programming language domain has solved many *meta-problems* and provides a platform of powerful abstractions which can be used in many domain specific problems. I think there is a fun factor involved as well. Any computer scientist or hacker with a decent understanding of programming languages would probably tell you the same.

Lately, I've been very curious about philosophy too.
