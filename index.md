I am a hacker who has been around in the software industry since I graduated from NIT Calicut in 2014. I look forward to pursuing higher education in the near future.  Currently, I work as a software developer at [Acrodelon](http://acrodelon.com/) on some very interesting problems.

## Interests

Technology excites me. But not more than the underlying theory. My specific theoretical interests (currently) include programming languages. I hope to do some research in the area of programming languages during my stint as a post-graduate student. 

More than the output of the research, it is the process of problem solving that I am more interested in. And for programming languages, because it is fun. Any computer scientist or hacker with a decent understanding of programming languages would tell you the same.
 
Also, I am intrigued by metaproblems and hence, very curious about philosophy.
