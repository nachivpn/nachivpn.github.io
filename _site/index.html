    <h1><a href="./">Nachi Vpn</a></h1>
    <p>I am a hacker who has been around in the software industry since I graduated from NIT Calicut in 2014. I look forward to pursuing higher education in the near future.  Currently, I work as a software developer at <a href="http://acrodelon.com/">Acrodelon</a> on some very interesting problems.</p>

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>

<p>Technology excites me. But not more than the underlying theory. My specific theoretical interests (currently) include programming languages. I hope to do some research in the area of programming languages during my stint as a post-graduate student. </p>

<p>More than the output of the research, it is the process of problem solving that I am more interested in. And for programming languages, because it is fun. Any computer scientist or hacker with a decent understanding of programming languages would tell you the same.</p>

<p>Also, I am intrigued by metaproblems and hence, very curious about philosophy.</p>
